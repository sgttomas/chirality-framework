**Station Lens: Problem Statement**

Through the lens of "Problem Statement," each cell becomes a coordinate for articulating *what is problematic* in its domain.

|               | ontology | praxeology | epistemology | axiology |
|---------------|----------|------------|--------------|----------|
| **normative** | The problem of establishing legitimate foundational structures—what axioms to hold, how to classify behaviors properly, what evaluative architecture to build, what grounds coherence | The problem of right action—what signals should guide, what conduct is proper, what principles govern judgment, what standards measure integrity | The problem of justified belief—what makes evidence principled, how conduct traces to source, what frameworks enable evaluation, what depth coherence requires | The problem of legitimate value—what engages us rightly, what makes action appropriate, what gives assessment meaning, what aligns wholeness with purpose |
| **operative** | The problem of structural execution—what facts procedures must engage, how methods should classify, what criteria govern structure, how adaptation maintains ground | The problem of practice itself—how procedures signal, what protocols methods follow, what principles criteria embody, how adaptation is measured | The problem of knowledge production—how procedures gather evidence, where methods originate, what frameworks criteria employ, how adaptation achieves depth | The problem of value realization—how procedures engage significance, what makes methods relevant, what meaning criteria carry, how adaptation serves purpose |
| **descriptive** | The problem of accurate observation—what facts are observed, how taxonomies are recorded, how structure is assessed, how understanding is grounded | The problem of practice documentation—what signals are observed, how protocols are recorded, how principles assess practice, how understanding is measured | The problem of epistemic observation—what evidence is observed, how provenance is recorded, how frameworks are assessed, how comprehension penetrates | The problem of value recognition—what engages attention, what relevance is documented, what significance is assessed, what purpose understanding serves |

**Station Lens: Requirements**

Through the lens of "Requirements," each cell becomes a specification of *what must be provided or satisfied* for the problem to be addressed.

|               | ontology | praxeology | epistemology | axiology |
|---------------|----------|------------|--------------|----------|

| **operative** | **Require:** taxonomic organization of structural operations—methods acting on structure must be classified and systematized | **Require:** protocol formalization for practice—methodological sequences must be codified into repeatable, governable procedures | **Require:** provenance tracking for knowledge production—methods must carry traceable origins and generation histories | **Require:** relevance criteria for value operations—contextual pertinence of value-realizing methods must be established and maintained |
| **descriptive** | **Require:** architectural integration of observation—perceptual systems must be structured to relate observations systematically | **Require:** principled documentation standards—practice records must be governed by explicit principles that shape recording | **Require:** epistemic observation frameworks—structures for perceiving and assessing knowledge itself must be developed | **Require:** meaning structures for value recognition—the significance of perceived value must be articulable and integrated |

**Station Lens: Objectives**

Through the lens of "Objectives," each cell becomes an *actionable goal*—something to be achieved that combines a framing stance with a resolution target.

|               | ontology | praxeology | epistemology | axiology |
|---------------|----------|------------|--------------|----------|
| **normative** | **Objective:** Establish principled factual foundations—use normative principles to guide identification of the raw data that will ground legitimate structures, achieving axiomatic clarity through principled framing | **Objective:** Define conduct-oriented action signals—use proper conduct to frame the specification of primitive indicators, achieving right-action guidance through behavioral framing | **Objective:** Secure evaluation-grounded evidence—use evaluative judgment to frame the gathering and validation of epistemic material, achieving justified belief through evaluative framing | **Objective:** Surface integrity-aligned value hooks—use integrity to frame identification of primitive attractors, achieving legitimate concern through coherent framing |
| **operative** | **Objective:** Develop procedure-organized taxonomies—use procedural framing to classify and systematize structural operations, achieving operational clarity through procedural organization | **Objective:** Codify method-governed protocols—use methodological framing to formalize practice sequences, achieving practice governance through method codification | **Objective:** Establish criteria-tracked provenance—use criterial framing to track knowledge-production origins, achieving epistemic traceability through criterial governance | **Objective:** Maintain adaptation-relevant value criteria—use adaptive framing to establish contextual pertinence, achieving value realization through adaptive relevance |
| **descriptive** | **Objective:** Integrate observation-structured architecture—use observational framing to systematize perception, achieving accurate observation through architectural integration | **Objective:** Govern documentation-principled records—use documentation framing to establish recording standards, achieving practice legibility through principled documentation | **Objective:** Develop assessment-oriented epistemic frameworks—use assessment framing to structure knowledge observation, achieving epistemic clarity through framework development | **Objective:** Articulate understanding-meaningful recognition—use understanding to frame value recognition, achieving significance through meaning articulation |

**Station Lens: Verification**

Through the lens of "Verification," each cell becomes a *validation criterion*—what must be verified and through what lens the verification proceeds.

|                  | ontology | praxeology | epistemology | axiology |
|------------------|----------|------------|--------------|----------|
| **ontology**     | **Verify:** structural self-coherence—confirm that foundational facts are factual, taxonomic organization is organized, and architectural integration integrates; the structure must stand examination by its own structural criteria | **Verify:** structural actionability—confirm that foundations emit proper signals, taxonomies yield protocols, and architecture embodies principles; structure must translate into practice | **Verify:** structural knowability—confirm that foundations constitute evidence, taxonomies carry provenance, and architecture supports frameworks; structure must be epistemically accessible | **Verify:** structural significance—confirm that foundations engage concern, taxonomies connect to relevance, and architecture carries meaning; structure must matter |

Based on the **Chirality Framework** rules provided in the document, here is the generation of **Matrix C (Formulation)**.

This process follows the **Two-Track Architecture**:

1. **Computational Substrate:** We perform the dot product of Matrix A and Matrix B. This results in list-valued intermediates (collections of 4 semantic products per cell).
2. **Interpretation:** We apply the operator **I(r, c, L)** to coerce those lists into atomic semantic units.
3. **Lensing:** The final matrix is viewed through the "Formulation" lens.

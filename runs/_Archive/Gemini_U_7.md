Here is the sequence of matrices culminating in Matrix E, constructed according to the Chirality Framework's semantic algebra and interpretation rules.

### Matrix C (Formulation)

*Construction: `C = I(r, c, A · B)*` *Logic: The semantic intersection of Activity (A) and Knowledge (B). It represents how abstract activities are formulated into understandable domains.*

|  | **ontology** | **epistemology** | **praxeology** | **axiology** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **normative** | Constitutional Definition | Compliance Audit | Governance Protocol | Strategic Alignment |
| **operative** | System Architecture | Design Validation | Operational Procedure | Performance Metric |
| **descriptive** | Observed State | Behavioral Record | Production Output | Quality Grade |

---

### Matrix J (Truncated Knowledge)

*Construction: Matrix B with the "wisdom" row removed.*

|  | **ontology** | **epistemology** | **praxeology** | **axiology** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **data** | fact | evidence | signal | accuracy |
| **information** | context | traceability | analysis | relevance |
| **knowledge** | model | verification | method | validation |

---

### Matrix F (Requirements)

*Construction: `F = I(r, c, J ⊙ C)*` *Logic: The Hadamard product of raw knowledge tiers (J) and formulated activity (C). This anchors abstract formulations into concrete requirements.*

|  | **ontology** | **epistemology** | **praxeology** | **axiology** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **normative** | Statutory Fact | Audit Trail | Control Mechanism | Precision Standard |
| **operative** | Contextual Framework | Traceable Design | Process Logic | Key Performance Indicator |
| **descriptive** | Digital Twin | Test Result | Capability Output | Certified Rating |

---

### Matrix D (Objectives)

*Construction: `D = I(r, c, A + ("resolution" * F))*` *Logic: Adding "resolved" requirements back to the original activity structure. This shifts the meaning from "what must be done" (Activity) to "what is achieved" (Objectives).*

|  | **mandate** | **specification** | **execution** | **warrant** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **normative** | Legal Settlement | Certified Requirement | Enforced Compliance | Qualified Threshold |
| **operative** | Authorized Mission | Finalized Blueprint | Deployed Workflow | Validated Gate |
| **descriptive** | Boundary Condition | Verified Configuration | Deliverable Asset | Proven Substantiation |

---

### Matrix K (Transposed Objectives)

*Construction: `K = Transpose(D)*` *Note: This strictly uses the un-lensed interpreted values from D.*

|  | **normative** | **operative** | **descriptive** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **mandate** | Legal Settlement | Authorized Mission | Boundary Condition |
| **specification** | Certified Requirement | Finalized Blueprint | Verified Configuration |
| **execution** | Enforced Compliance | Deployed Workflow | Deliverable Asset |
| **warrant** | Qualified Threshold | Validated Gate | Proven Substantiation |

---

### Matrix X (Verification)

*Construction: `X = I(r, c, K · J)*` *Logic: The dot product of Objectives (K) and Knowledge (J). This maps objectives against the hierarchy of data, information, and knowledge to verify the system.*

|  | **ontology** | **epistemology** | **praxeology** | **axiology** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **mandate** | Chartered Domain | Regulatory Evidence | Command Signal | Scope Accuracy |
| **specification** | System Definition | Traceability Matrix | Logic Analysis | Design Relevance |
| **execution** | Operational Capability | Implementation Log | Methodological Integrity | Validation Report |
| **warrant** | Assurance Case | Justification Evidence | Governance Signal | Quality Standard |

---

### Matrix G (Truncated Verification)

*Construction: Matrix X with the "warrant" row removed.*

|  | **ontology** | **epistemology** | **praxeology** | **axiology** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **mandate** | Chartered Domain | Regulatory Evidence | Command Signal | Scope Accuracy |
| **specification** | System Definition | Traceability Matrix | Logic Analysis | Design Relevance |
| **execution** | Operational Capability | Implementation Log | Methodological Integrity | Validation Report |

---

### Matrix T (Transposed Knowledge)

*Construction: `T = Transpose(J)*`

|  | **data** | **information** | **knowledge** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **ontology** | fact | context | model |
| **epistemology** | evidence | traceability | verification |
| **praxeology** | signal | analysis | method |
| **axiology** | accuracy | relevance | validation |

---

### Matrix E (Evaluation)

*Construction: `E = I(r, c, G · T)*` *Logic: The dot product of Verification (G) and Transposed Knowledge (T). It synthesizes the verification artifacts into a final evaluation grid.*

|  | **data** | **information** | **knowledge** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **mandate** | Terms of Reference | Feasibility Study | Strategic Model |
| **specification** | Requirements Baseline | Technical Architecture | System Theory |
| **execution** | Performance Log | Status Report | Mature Proficiency |

Here is the construction of **Matrix C (Formulation)** based on the Chirality Framework v5 (unlensed).

## Construction Logic

Matrix C is the product of Matrix A (Activity) and Matrix B (Knowledge).
**Formula:** `C = A · B`
**Dimensions:** A (3×4) · B (4×4) = C (3×4)

The operation follows these steps for every cell `C(i,j)`:

1. **Collection:** Calculate the dot product `L_C(i,j) = Σ_k (A(i,k) * B(k,j))`.
* The summation `k` runs from 1 to 4, pairing the columns of A with the rows of B:
* k=1: Mandate * Data
* k=2: Specification * Information
* k=3: Execution * Knowledge
* k=4: Warrant * Wisdom




2. **Interpretation:** Apply `I(row_i, col_j, L_C(i,j))` to synthesize the atomic unit.

## Construction Logic

Matrix F is constructed by taking the **Hadamard product** of Matrix J and Matrix C, and then interpreting the result.
**Formula:** `F = I(J ⊙ C)`
**Dimensions:** J (3×4) ⊙ C (3×4) = F (3×4)

**Inputs:**

**Next Step:** Would you like me to proceed with generating **Matrix D (Objectives)**?

Here is the construction of **Matrix D (Objectives)** based on the Chirality Framework v5 (unlensed).

## Construction Logic

Matrix D defines the specific objectives for each cell by combining the Activity Structure (Matrix A) with a "resolved" version of the Requirements (Matrix F).

**Dimensions:** 3×4 (Rows: [normative, operative, descriptive]; Cols: [mandate, specification, execution, warrant])

**Mapping Convention:**
Since Matrix F uses [ontology, epistemology, praxeology, axiology] columns and Matrix D uses [mandate, specification, execution, warrant], we map them column-by-column based on position (Col 1 to Col 1, etc.):

* **Mandate** objectives  **Ontology** requirements (Baseline)

# Matrix C Construction

I'll work through each step systematically, showing the intermediate semantic products before applying the interpretation operator.

---

## Step 1: Semantic Products for Each Cell

For each cell C(i,j), I compute the four semantic products A(i,k) * B(k,j) where k iterates over [mandate↔data, specification↔information, execution↔knowledge, warrant↔wisdom].

---

### Row: **normative**

**C(normative, ontology):**

|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | directive | accuracy | commanded precision |
| 2 | design | relevance | planned pertinence |
| 3 | implementation | validation | enacted confirmation |
| 4 | decision | prudence | chosen judgment |

`L_C(operative, axiology) = {commanded precision, planned pertinence, enacted confirmation, chosen judgment}`

---

### Row: **descriptive**

**C(descriptive, ontology):**
| k | A(descriptive, k) | B(k, ontology) | Product |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | constraint | fact | limiting truth |
| 2 | configuration | context | arranged situation |
| 3 | outcome | model | resultant structure |
| 4 | substantiation | principle | evidenced foundation |

`L_C(descriptive, ontology) = {limiting truth, arranged situation, resultant structure, evidenced foundation}`

---

---

## Step 2: Interpretation I(r, c, L)

|---|---|---|---|---|
| **normative** | prescriptive grounding | mandated justification | compliant procedure | fitness criteria |
| **operative** | working architecture | operational rationale | execution protocol | performance fitness |
| **descriptive** | actual state | documented basis | recorded process | measured worth |

# Matrix F Construction

Matrix F requires the Hadamard product of J and C. Let me work through each step.

---

## Step 1: Matrix J (Truncate B)

Remove the wisdom row from Matrix B:

| | **ontology** | **epistemology** | **praxeology** | **axiology** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **data** | fact | evidence | signal | accuracy |
| **information** | context | traceability | analysis | relevance |
| **knowledge** | model | verification | method | validation |

---

## Step 2: Recall Matrix C (Un-lensed Interpreted)

| | **ontology** | **epistemology** | **praxeology** | **axiology** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **normative** | prescriptive grounding | mandated justification | compliant procedure | fitness criteria |
| **operative** | working architecture | operational rationale | execution protocol | performance fitness |
| **descriptive** | actual state | documented basis | recorded process | measured worth |

---

## Step 3: Hadamard Product F_raw(i,j) = J(i,j) * C(i,j)

The Hadamard product operates element-wise on matrices of equal dimension (3×4). Row indices align positionally: data↔normative, information↔operative, knowledge↔descriptive.

---

### Row: **normative** (using J row: data)

| Cell | J(data, col) | C(normative, col) | Semantic Product |
|---|---|---|---|
| (normative, ontology) | fact | prescriptive grounding | factual mandate |
| (normative, epistemology) | evidence | mandated justification | evidentiary requirement |

| (normative, axiology) | accuracy | fitness criteria | precision standard |

---

### Row: **operative** (using J row: information)

| (operative, epistemology) | traceability | operational rationale | auditable reasoning |
| (operative, praxeology) | analysis | execution protocol | procedural analysis |
| (operative, axiology) | relevance | performance fitness | applicable effectiveness |

---

### Row: **descriptive** (using J row: knowledge)

| Cell | J(knowledge, col) | C(descriptive, col) | Semantic Product |
|---|---|---|---|

| (descriptive, epistemology) | verification | documented basis | verified documentation |
| (descriptive, praxeology) | method | recorded process | procedural record |
| (descriptive, axiology) | validation | measured worth | confirmed merit |

---

## Step 4: Interpretation I(r, c, F_raw)

Since each semantic product `*` yields an atomic unit, interpretation is identity for all cells.

---

### I(normative, ontology, "factual mandate")

- **Input already atomic:** factual mandate
- **Output:** `factual mandate`

### I(normative, epistemology, "evidentiary requirement")

- **Input already atomic:** applicable effectiveness
- **Output:** `applicable effectiveness`

---

### I(descriptive, ontology, "represented actuality")
- **Axis anchor:** descriptive * ontology = *observed existence*
- **Input already atomic:** represented actuality
- **Output:** `represented actuality`

### I(descriptive, epistemology, "verified documentation")
- **Axis anchor:** descriptive * epistemology = *observed knowing*
- **Input already atomic:** verified documentation
- **Output:** `verified documentation`

### I(descriptive, praxeology, "procedural record")

- **Output:** `procedural record`

### I(descriptive, axiology, "confirmed merit")
- **Axis anchor:** descriptive * axiology = *observed value*
- **Input already atomic:** confirmed merit
- **Output:** `confirmed merit`

---

| **operative** | contextual framework | auditable reasoning | procedural analysis | applicable effectiveness |
| **descriptive** | represented actuality | verified documentation | procedural record | confirmed merit |

---

## Step 3: Positional Column Mapping

Matrix D columns map positionally to Matrix F columns:
- mandate (j=1) ↔ ontology
- specification (j=2) ↔ epistemology
- execution (j=3) ↔ praxeology
- warrant (j=4) ↔ axiology

---

## Step 4: Compute "resolution" * F(i,j) for Each Cell

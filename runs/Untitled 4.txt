## Matrix C — Lensed through "Problem Statement"

|              | ontology | praxeology | epistemology | axiology |
|--------------|----------|------------|--------------|----------|
| **normative** | What foundational structures should exist but may be missing or malformed? | What action-guiding standards should govern practice but are unclear or absent? | What justificatory frameworks for norms are needed but not established? | What value-anchors should orient normative commitment but lack articulation? |
| **operative** | What operational entities need to exist for work to proceed? | What methods or procedures need specification or refinement? | What warrants for operational choices are missing or inadequate? | What makes this work worth doing, and is that clarity present? |
| **descriptive** | What states of affairs need to be observed and understood? | What observational practices need to be in place to capture relevant signals? | What evidential standards and provenance requirements are unmet? | What significance should be assigned to observations, and how is this determined? |

| **operative** | *Requires:* Information structures must classify procedures, categorize techniques, typologize standards, and taxonomize adaptive options. | *Requires:* Protocols must specify trigger-handling, procedures must encode conventions, rules must instantiate guidance, and routines must enable responsiveness. | *Requires:* Provenance systems must trace procedural lineage, enable method traceability, document standard origins, and record insight sources. | *Requires:* Relevance criteria must specify catalyst pertinence, method relevance, criterial salience, and goal significance. |
| **descriptive** | *Requires:* Knowledge-level architectures must structure observations, organize records, schema-tize appraisals, and edifice comprehension. | *Requires:* Principles must govern detection, rules must encode conventions, canons must guide measurement, and guidelines must enable sense-making. | *Requires:* Frameworks must scaffold empirical claims, structure documentation, systematize appraisal, and schema-tize comprehension pathways. | *Requires:* Meaning frameworks must specify attention-significance, record-meaning, evaluative import, and purpose-significance. |

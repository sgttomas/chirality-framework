### Lensed Matrix C (Station: Problem Statement)

Viewed through the "Problem Statement" lens, each cell becomes a region from which problem articulation can emerge:

| | **ontology** | **praxeology** | **epistemology** | **axiology** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **normative** | What structural realities *should* exist but may not? What categorical commitments does the standard require? | What practices *should* be followed but aren't? What procedural standards are unmet? | What justifications *should* ground our knowledge but are missing? What epistemic standards are violated? | What values *should* orient us but don't? What purposes remain unachieved? |
| **operative** | What operational realities are missing or malformed? What procedural facts are absent? | What methods are failing? What operational protocols break down? | What operational knowledge is unjustified or missing provenance? | What operational purposes are unclear or unengaging? |
| **descriptive** | What do we observe to actually exist, and where does it diverge from need? | What practices do we actually witness, and how do they fall short? | What do we actually know, and where are the gaps in evidence and framework? | What do we actually value, and where does meaning fail to cohere? |

Frame *how action should proceed* through conduct standards; achieve resolution by establishing directive cues, procedural triggers, evaluative signals, and integrity indicators that guide proper practice. | **Objective:** Justify normative evaluation. Frame *what judgments are warranted* through evaluation criteria; achieve resolution by securing verified foundations, attested provenance, justified evaluation, and warranted integration for normative claims. | **Objective:** Integrate normative purpose. Frame *why standards matter* through integrity; achieve resolution by establishing compelling grounds, actionable relevance, evaluative salience, and purposive attraction that motivate adherence. |
| **operative** | **Objective:** Structure operational existence. Frame *what operations must exist* through procedure; achieve resolution by establishing classified operations, method categories, structured standards, and adaptive classifications that organize the operational domain. | **Objective:** Sequence operational execution. Frame *how operations proceed* through methods; achieve resolution by establishing procedural checkpoints, method protocols, guideline sequences, and adaptive procedures that govern execution. | **Objective:** Trace operational provenance. Frame *how we know operations are valid* through criteria; achieve resolution by establishing traced operations, method lineage, standard derivation, and adaptive origins that justify operational knowledge. | **Objective:** Ground operational significance. Frame *why operations matter* through adaptation; achieve resolution by establishing operational pertinence, method importance, criterial relevance, and adaptive significance that motivate operational commitment. |
| **descriptive** | **Objective:** Document observed existence. Frame *what is actually witnessed* through observation; achieve resolution by establishing structural observations, documented architecture, assessed structures, and understood foundations that describe ontological reality. | **Objective:** Record observed practice. Frame *what is actually done* through documentation; achieve resolution by establishing principled observations, documented principles, assessed guidelines, and understood standards that describe praxeological reality. | **Objective:** Assess observed knowledge. Frame *what is actually known* through assessment; achieve resolution by establishing observed frameworks, documented derivations, assessed frameworks, and understood structures that describe epistemic reality. | **Objective:** Comprehend observed meaning. Frame *what actually matters* through understanding; achieve resolution by establishing observed meanings, documented significance, assessed meanings, and understood purposes that describe axiological reality. |

# Task: Generate Matrix E

## Matrix E (Evaluation)

Generated according to the Chirality Framework methodology.

### Construction Chain
- Matrix J (truncate B) → Matrix T (transpose J)
- Matrix C (A · B) → Matrix F (J ⊙ C) → Matrix D (A + resolution·F)
- Matrix K (transpose D) → Matrix X (K · J) → Matrix G (truncate X)
- Matrix E = G · T

### Matrix E

| | **data** | **information** | **knowledge** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **mandate** | authoritative fact | directive context | verified authority |
| **specification** | structural evidence | traceable specification | validated structure |
| **execution** | performance evidence | operational traceability | verified performance |

### Interpretation

Matrix E represents the **Evaluation** structure:
- **Rows** (mandate/specification/execution): Organizational phases being evaluated
- **Columns** (data/information/knowledge): Epistemic substrate of evaluation
- **Cells**: Semantic attractors anchoring evaluation activity

Each cell tiles the evaluation domain following the framework principle of "seed, don't specify" - providing coordinates in semantic space rather than enumerated procedures.

## Step 4: Un-lensed Interpreted Matrix C

---

## Step 5: Apply Lens (Formulation)

The **Formulation** lens views each cell through the perspective of how knowledge is initially constituted and framed—the generative shaping of inquiry.

---

### Lensed Matrix C (Formulation)

|               | ontology     | epistemology | axiology       | praxeology |
|---------------|--------------|--------------|----------------|-----------|

| **descriptive**| What empirical entities must be catalogued to map the territory? | What evidential traces must be documented to establish lineage? | What significance markers must be recorded to capture importance? | What practical patterns must be observed to characterize activity? |

---

## Summary

**Un-lensed Interpreted Matrix C** provides the atomic semantic units that partition the formulation space.

**Lensed Matrix C (Formulation)** is the terminal interpretive overlay, expressing each cell as a generative question about how knowledge is initially framed and constituted within that coordinate.

I'll generate the lensed Matrix F by following the framework step by step.

## Step 1: Recall Source Matrices

### Matrix J (truncate B) - 3×4
Remove the final row (wisdom) from B.

|               | ontology     | epistemology | axiology       | praxeology |
|---------------|--------------|--------------|----------------|-----------|
| **data**      | fact | evidence | significance | signal |
| **information** | taxonomy | provenance | relevance | protocol |
| **knowledge** | architecture | framework | interpretation | principle |

### Un-lensed Interpreted Matrix C - 3×4
(From previous computation)

|               | ontology     | epistemology | axiology       | praxeology |
|---------------|--------------|--------------|----------------|-----------|
| **normative**  | categorical imperative | warranted legitimacy | ethical grounding | regulatory standard |
| **operative**  | functional specification | procedural validity | operational relevance | execution protocol |
| **descriptive**| empirical inventory | documented provenance | assessed significance | recorded practice |

## Step 2: Compute Hadamard Product F_raw(i,j) = J(i,j) * C(i,j)

The Hadamard product performs element-wise semantic multiplication. Note that J's rows [data, information, knowledge] align positionally with C's rows [normative, operative, descriptive].

---

### Row: normative (aligned with data row of J)

**F_raw(normative, ontology) = fact * categorical imperative**
The semantic intersection of raw datum with prescriptive categorical structure.
→ **foundational assertion**

**F_raw(normative, epistemology) = evidence * warranted legitimacy**
The semantic intersection of evidential support with justified authority.
→ **substantiated authority**

**F_raw(normative, axiology) = significance * ethical grounding**
The semantic intersection of importance with moral foundation.
→ **moral weight**

**F_raw(normative, praxeology) = signal * regulatory standard**
The semantic intersection of indicator with governing rule.
→ **compliance indicator**

---

### Row: operative (aligned with information row of J)

**F_raw(operative, ontology) = taxonomy * functional specification**
The semantic intersection of classification system with operational definition.
→ **classified component**

**F_raw(operative, epistemology) = provenance * procedural validity**
The semantic intersection of origin tracing with process legitimacy.
→ **traceable process**

**F_raw(operative, axiology) = relevance * operational relevance**
The semantic intersection of pertinence with practical priority.
→ **applicable priority**

**F_raw(operative, praxeology) = protocol * execution protocol**
The semantic intersection of procedural rule with performance routine.
→ **executable routine**

---

### Row: descriptive (aligned with knowledge row of J)

**F_raw(descriptive, ontology) = architecture * empirical inventory**
The semantic intersection of structural design with documented entities.
→ **structural catalog**

**F_raw(descriptive, epistemology) = framework * documented provenance**
The semantic intersection of conceptual scaffold with traced lineage.
→ **analytical lineage**

**F_raw(descriptive, axiology) = interpretation * assessed significance**
The semantic intersection of meaning-making with recorded importance.
→ **interpreted salience**

**F_raw(descriptive, praxeology) = principle * recorded practice**
The semantic intersection of guiding rule with observed activity.
→ **practiced guideline**

---

## Step 3: Apply Interpretation Operator (Identity Case)

Since each F_raw(i,j) is already a single atomic unit (the `*` operation produced atomic outputs), the interpretation operator acts as identity:

`F(i,j) = I(row_i, col_j, F_raw(i,j)) = F_raw(i,j)`

---

## Step 4: Un-lensed Interpreted Matrix F

|               | ontology     | epistemology | axiology       | praxeology |
|---------------|--------------|--------------|----------------|-----------|
| **normative**  | foundational assertion | substantiated authority | moral weight | compliance indicator |
| **operative**  | classified component | traceable process | applicable priority | executable routine |
| **descriptive**| structural catalog | analytical lineage | interpreted salience | practiced guideline |

---

## Step 5: Apply Lens (Requirements)

The **Requirements** lens views each cell through the perspective of what must be satisfied, met, or fulfilled—the necessary conditions for adequate knowledge work.

---

### Lensed Matrix F (Requirements)

|               | ontology     | epistemology | axiology       | praxeology |
|---------------|--------------|--------------|----------------|-----------|
| **normative**  | What foundational claims must be asserted and accepted as given? | What authoritative grounds must be substantiated to legitimize prescriptions? | What moral considerations must carry sufficient weight to bind judgment? | What compliance markers must be present to confirm adherence to standards? |
| **operative**  | What classified components must be identified and categorized for the system to function? | What process lineages must be traceable to ensure procedural legitimacy? | What priorities must be deemed applicable to guide resource allocation? | What routines must be executable to deliver consistent performance? |
| **descriptive**| What structural elements must be catalogued to constitute a complete account? | What analytical lineages must be documented to establish evidential chains? | What salience judgments must be interpreted to distinguish the significant from the trivial? | What practiced guidelines must be observed and recorded to characterize actual behavior? |

---

## Summary

**Un-lensed Interpreted Matrix F** provides the atomic semantic units formed by the Hadamard product of J and C—combining the knowledge-level constraints (data/information/knowledge) with the formulated coordinates.

**Lensed Matrix F (Requirements)** is the terminal interpretive overlay, expressing each cell as a necessary condition or specification that must be fulfilled within that coordinate of knowledge work.

---

## Step 3: Apply Interpretation Operator I(r, c, L)

For each cell, I find the single atomic unit that captures the shared semantic core of all contributors, conditioned by the row and column axes (without naming them).

---

### Row: normative

## Step 4: Un-lensed Interpreted Matrix X

|               | ontology     | epistemology | axiology       | praxeology |
|---------------|--------------|--------------|----------------|-----------|

## Summary

**Un-lensed Interpreted Matrix X** provides the atomic semantic units formed by the dot product of K (transposed objectives) and J (knowledge structure)—representing the verification coordinates where objectives meet epistemic constraints.

**Lensed Matrix X (Verification)** is the terminal interpretive overlay, expressing each cell as a verification question or test that must be satisfied to confirm proper execution within that coordinate of knowledge work.

I'll generate the lensed Matrix E by following the framework step by step.

## Step 1: Recall Source Matrices

### Matrix G (truncate X) - 3×4

Retain rows [guiding, applying, judging] from un-lensed interpreted X; drop [reflecting].

| **applying**  | mobilized element | verified basis | justified application | executable pattern |
| **judging**| assessed category | justified criterion | determined merit | operative measure |

### Matrix T (transpose of J) - 4×3

T(i,j) = J(j,i)

Rows: [ontology, epistemology, axiology, praxeology]
Columns: [data, information, knowledge]

|               | data     | information | knowledge |

## Summary

**Un-lensed Interpreted Matrix E** provides the atomic semantic units formed by the dot product of G (truncated verification matrix) and T (transposed knowledge structure)—representing the evaluation coordinates where verified activity meets knowledge levels.

**Lensed Matrix E (Evaluation)** is the terminal interpretive overlay, expressing each cell as an evaluative question that assesses whether the knowledge work at that coordinate has achieved adequacy, correctness, and sufficiency. This matrix represents the final stage of the framework's sequence, where all prior formulations, requirements, objectives, and verifications culminate in comprehensive evaluation.

# Changelog

All notable changes to the Chirality Framework will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [17.0.0] - 2025-09-05

### Added
-   **Asset-Based Prompt System**: Introduced a new `chirality/prompt_assets/` directory to externalize all semantic content (system prompts, station briefs, operator instructions) into maintainer-authored markdown files.
-   **Prompt Assembly Engine**: Added a new `chirality/lib/` module containing:
    -   `PromptRegistry`: Loads and validates all prompt assets against a `metadata.yml` manifest, checking versions and SHA256 checksums.
    -   `PromptBuilder`: Assembles prompts from assets according to a canonical pipeline.
    -   `Strategies`: Defines the fixed order of asset assembly for each pipeline stage.
-   **Dedicated LLM Client**: Added `llm_client.py` and `llm_config.py` to create a single, exclusive wrapper for the OpenAI Responses API and centralize model configuration.

### Changed
-   **Major Architectural Refactoring**: The core semantic pipeline has been completely rewritten.
    -   Replaced the old 3-step lensing process (column, row, synthesis) with a single, unified **Combined Lensing** call for all interpretations.
    -   The `CellResolver` class was completely refactored with a new, canonical API (`run_stage2_multiply`, `run_combined_lens`, etc.).
    -   All `compute_cell_*` functions in `operations.py` were updated to use the new canonical pipeline.
-   **Semantic Update**: The axiomatic matrices `A`, `B`, and `J` were updated with new canonical definitions.
-   **API Correction**: The OpenAI API client was updated to exclusively use the `Responses` API, as per maintainer directive.
-   **Provenance Schema**: Simplified the provenance structure to reflect the new pipeline, replacing the separate lensing stages with a single `stage_3_combined_lensed` field.

### Removed
-   **`chirality/core/prompts.py`**: This file has been deleted. All prompt content now lives as assets in `chirality/prompt_assets/`.
-   **Old Lensing Logic**: Removed the `_perform_three_step_lensing` helper function and all associated code for the separate column/row/synthesis steps from the codebase.

### BREAKING CHANGES

-   The internal Python API for cell computation (specifically the methods in `CellResolver` and the structure of `operations.py`) has been completely redesigned and is not backward-compatible.
-   The detailed 5-stage provenance structure previously exported is now obsolete and has been replaced by a simpler 3-stage structure. Any tools that consume trace or provenance data will need to be updated.

## [16.2.0] - 2025-09-04

### Fixed
- **OpenAI Integration**: Fixed critical OpenAI API client implementation
  - Corrected `client.responses.create()` to `client.chat.completions.create()`
  - Fixed response parsing to use `resp.choices[0].message.content`
  - Made JSON validation more permissive for `terms_used` and `warnings` fields
  - Restored correct model name "gpt-4.1-nano"
- **Matrix Context Handling**: Simplified Matrix X and E context to use `{"content": combined_concepts}`
- **Prompt Engineering**: Enhanced final synthesis prompt for 1-2 compact sentences without structural scaffolding

### Enhanced

## [16.0.1] - 2025-08-31

### Fixed
- Fixed version synchronization between VERSION.md and pyproject.toml to ensure correct PyPI packaging
- Fixed indentation error in Neo4j working memory exporter that was causing import failures
- Updated PyPI deployment workflow with correct project URL

### Changed
- Added version synchronization checker script (`scripts/check_version_sync.py`)
- Added comprehensive PyPI deployment documentation (`docs/PYPI_DEPLOYMENT.md`)

## [16.0.0] - 2025-08-31

### Added
- Universal, metadata-rich 5-stage provenance schema for all matrices (C, F, D):
  - stage_1_construct, stage_2_semantic, stage_3_column_lensed, stage_4_row_lensed, stage_5_final_synthesis.
- RichResult response type across resolvers with text, terms_used, warnings, and resolver metadata (modelId, latencyMs, promptHash, createdAt, phase).
- Universal Neo4j exporter with a single UNWIND-based Cypher that persists all five stages, rich metadata, and full context.
- Run/session scoping in exporter: (:Run {id}) nodes with (:Run)-[:CONTAINS]->(:Cell|:Stage) relationships; CLI generates a run_id per invocation for Neo4j exports.

### Changed
- Standardized API naming for D: `compute_cell_D`, `compute_matrix_D` (previously `synthesize_*`).
- Centralized prompt construction in `chirality/core/prompts.py` using explicit builders; resolver no longer exposes `assemble_prompt`.
- CLI verbose flows now display universal lensing steps: Column → Row → Final.

### Removed
- Backward compatibility shims and legacy fields/methods:
  - Removed `apply_ontological_lens` and any `assemble_prompt` usage.
  - Removed legacy provenance keys: `stage_1_products`, `stage_2_resolved`, `stage_3_lensed`, `stage_1_synthesis`.
  - Exporter no longer accepts legacy formats; provenance must be dict-shaped per stage with text/texts, terms_used, warnings, metadata.

### BREAKING CHANGES
- Provenance schema and resolver API changed:
  - Per-stage provenance is now dict-shaped and mandatory.
  - D functions renamed to `compute_*`; the CLI no longer accepts a custom `--problem` for D (canonical problem only).
- Export graph schema changed:
  - Universal five-stage pipeline with new labels and properties.
  - Run scoping added; existing queries should include `(:Run)` where appropriate.

## [15.0.2] - 2025-08-29

### Changed
- Refactored versioning to use `VERSION.md` as a single source of truth, removing hardcoded versions from the CLI and documentation.
- Updated core concept description from "deterministic" to "procedurally-rigorous methodology on a stochastic process" to more accurately reflect the architecture.

### Fixed
- Removed all outdated "CF14" version identifiers from current documentation and code for consistency.
- Renamed `CF14ValidationError` to `FrameworkValidationError` to align with the current project branding.

## [15.0.1] - 2025-08-29

### Fixed
- Corrected `.env` loading to ensure proper environment variable handling.
- Fixed a bug in the JSONL tracer to ensure accurate trace output.
- Resolved a missing import for Neo4j integration.

### Changed
- Enabled dual output for JSONL traces and Neo4j working memory for enhanced observability.

### Added
- Completed API reference documentation.
- Added a comprehensive prompt engineering guide.
- Included Neo4j query examples for advanced analysis.
- Added a tutorial for new users.

## [15.0.0] - 2025-08-29

### Added
- **Core Algorithm**: Introduced a three-stage interpretation pipeline (Combinatorial, Semantic Resolution, Ontological Lensing).
- **CLI**: Added a new `compute-cell` command with flags for verbosity, tracing, and Neo4j export.

### Changed
- **Major Architectural Refactoring**: This is a complete rewrite with a new CLI, simplified types, and different import paths. The project is transformed from a flexible framework into a fixed "semantic calculator" algorithm.

### BREAKING CHANGES
- This release is a complete architectural rewrite and is not backward-compatible.
- The CLI has been completely changed, with `compute-cell` as the new primary command.
- All import paths have been updated due to the new structure.
## [16.3.0] - 2025-09-04

### Added
- App Integration Mode in `compute-pipeline` with `--out`, `--problem-file`, and `--max-seconds`:
  - Writes per-cell `cells-jsonl-v1` snapshots for C/D/X/E under `runs/<run_id>/snapshots/`.
  - Writes `runs/<run_id>/index.json` manifest last and atomically, including checksums, bytes, and record counts.
  - Emits a single final stdout JSON line with `run_id` and manifest path.
  - Exit codes standardized: 0 OK; 2 invalid args; 3 timeout; 4 I/O; 5 resolver; 1 general.
- Dual-write legacy snapshots for all computed matrices to `snapshots/<run_id>/` for viewer compatibility.
- New `chirality/exporters/manifest_exporter.py` and tests.
- New producer-side `docs/INTERFACE.md` and documentation updates (README, API_REFERENCE, TUTORIAL, AGENTS, CLAUDE).

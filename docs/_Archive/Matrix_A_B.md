### Semantic Multiplication `*`
Semantic multiplication combines two terms into their semantic intersection—the meaning that emerges when the meaning of both concepts are combined.

Examples:
- `"sufficient" * "reason" = "justification"`
- `"necessary" * "condition" = "prerequisite"`
- `"practical" * "knowledge" = "skill"`

### Application

To find the semantic intersection between two terms such that a matrix of meaning can be formed from the products.

### Matrix A
Size: 3×4  
Columns: [event, pattern, structure, paradigm] 
Rows: [normative, operative, descriptive]

| | **event** | **pattern** | **structure** | **paradigm** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **normative** | directive | standard | policy | ethos |
| **operative** | response | routine | process | methodology |
| **descriptive** | report | trend | model | worldview |


### Matrix B 
Size: 4×4  
Columns: [ontology, epistemology, praxeology, axiology]  
Rows: [data, information, knowledge, wisdom]  

| | **ontology** | **epistemology** | **praxeology** | **axiology** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **data** | registry | observation | telemetry | indicator |
| **information** | taxonomy | evidence | procedure | criteria |
| **knowledge** | model | methodology | playbook | rubric |
| **wisdom** | doctrine | warrant | strategy | charter |

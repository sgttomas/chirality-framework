If two expressions are ontologically, epistemologically, axiologically, and praxeologically congruent would they share close to the same meaning (even if expressed differently?)

evaluate these two files in that manner and explain your findings.

now compare those initial two files with these four, according to the same type of analysis of congruence.

Synthesize a "Rosetta Stone" table that merges these files into a single, unified glossary.

# Project Roadmap

**Status Last Updated**: August 28, 2025

## Current Status: Refactoring Complete

The project has recently undergone a major architectural refactoring. The previous goal of building a flexible, extensible "framework" has been replaced with a much clearer and more focused objective: to create a direct, observable implementation of the canonical Chirality Framework algorithm.

This transformation into a **"semantic calculator"** is now complete. The core logic, centered around the **Three-Stage Interpretation Pipeline**, is stable, tested, and consistent.

## Current Status: Core Implementation Complete ✅

The refactoring to a "semantic calculator" is **complete**! All core functionality has been implemented and tested:

✅ **CLI Implementation (`Phase 7`)** - **COMPLETE**
- `click`-based CLI with professional UX
- `compute-cell` command provides cell-first debugging
- `--verbose` flag shows all 3 stages step-by-step  
- Full integration with core operations tested

✅ **Testing Pipeline (`Phase 8`)** - **COMPLETE**
- Comprehensive test infrastructure in `/tests/`
- MockCellResolver for fast, offline testing
- All 3 stages tested independently and end-to-end
- 100% test coverage of core pipeline

✅ **Documentation (`Phase 9`)** - **COMPLETE**
- All documentation updated for semantic calculator philosophy
- Technical algorithm documentation complete
- CLI usage examples working and tested

## Next Development Priorities

With the core semantic calculator fully implemented and tested, future work can focus on extending capabilities and optimizing performance:

### High Priority
*   **Online Testing Suite**: Add `@pytest.mark.online` tests that validate against real OpenAI API calls
*   **Performance Optimization**: Profile the 3-stage pipeline and optimize `CellResolver` for speed and cost
*   **Enhanced Error Handling**: Improve robustness for edge cases and API failures

### Medium Priority  
*   **Extended Semantic Valley**: Implement next matrices in the canonical sequence (X, Z, etc.)
*   **LLM Experimentation**: Test different language models for optimal semantic resolution
*   **Tracing Analytics**: Build tools to analyze and visualize `JSONLTracer` output

### Low Priority
*   **Additional Export Formats**: CSV, Excel, or other matrix export options
*   **Advanced CLI Features**: Batch processing, configuration files
*   **Integration Adapters**: Additional database or API integrations

The core algorithm is stable and production-ready. All future work builds on this solid foundation.

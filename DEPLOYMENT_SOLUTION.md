# PyPI Deployment Issue: RESOLVED âœ…

## The Problem
User expected PyPI deployment to happen automatically after a push/merge to main, but it didn't occur.

## Root Cause
The PyPI deployment workflow was correctly configured for **release-based deployment**, not push-based deployment. This is the recommended security practice, but wasn't clearly documented.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced GitHub Actions Workflow âœ…
- **File**: `.github/workflows/python-publish.yml`
- **Added**: Manual deployment option via workflow dispatch
- **Added**: Version sync check before builds
- **Added**: Confirmation requirement for manual deployments
- **Fixed**: Job dependency issues

### 2. Comprehensive Documentation âœ…
- **Updated**: `docs/PYPI_DEPLOYMENT.md` with clear explanations
- **Added**: Troubleshooting section explaining why pushes don't trigger deployment
- **Added**: `QUICK_DEPLOY.md` quick reference guide

### 3. Helper Tools âœ…
- **Created**: `scripts/create_release.py` - One-click release creation
- **Created**: `scripts/verify_deployment.py` - Deployment readiness checker

### 4. Current Status Check âœ…
```bash
$ python scripts/verify_deployment.py
âœ… Versions synchronized: 16.2.0
âœ… Workflow configured for both releases and manual deployment  
ðŸ“¦ PyPI has 15.0.1, local is 16.2.0 - deployment needed
```

## Next Steps for the User

### Immediate Action Required
1. **Create GitHub Release for v16.2.0**:
   ```bash
   python scripts/create_release.py
   # Click the generated link and publish the release
   ```

2. **Monitor Deployment**:
   - Watch: https://github.com/sgttomas/chirality-framework/actions
   - Verify: https://pypi.org/project/chirality-framework/

### Future Deployments
1. Update `VERSION.md` and `pyproject.toml`
2. Update `CHANGELOG.md` 
3. Run `python scripts/create_release.py`
4. Create and publish GitHub release
5. PyPI deployment happens automatically

### Emergency Manual Deployment
- Go to: https://github.com/sgttomas/chirality-framework/actions/workflows/python-publish.yml
- Click "Run workflow"
- Type: `deploy-to-pypi`
- Deploy immediately (bypasses release process)

## Why This Approach?
- **Security**: Prevents accidental deployments from development pushes
- **Traceability**: Every PyPI version corresponds to a GitHub release
- **Documentation**: Release notes are automatically preserved
- **Control**: Allows review before deployment

## Files Modified
- `.github/workflows/python-publish.yml` - Enhanced workflow
- `docs/PYPI_DEPLOYMENT.md` - Updated documentation  
- `scripts/create_release.py` - NEW: Release creation helper
- `scripts/verify_deployment.py` - NEW: Deployment checker
- `QUICK_DEPLOY.md` - NEW: Quick reference guide

**STATUS**: âœ… RESOLVED - Deployment infrastructure is ready. User needs to create v16.2.0 release to deploy current version.

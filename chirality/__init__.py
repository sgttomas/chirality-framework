"""
Chirality Framework - A Semantic Calculator

This package provides a direct implementation of the Chirality Framework, a fixed,
canonical algorithm for structured problem-solving. It functions as a "semantic
calculator" that executes a specific sequence of semantic and structural matrix
operations to traverse a "semantic valley" from problem to evaluation.

The primary user interface is the command-line tool, which provides orchestration
for computing the entire pipeline and visualizing the results.

## Matrix F

[F]
Size: 3x4
Station: Requirements
Column names: ['Necessity (vs Contingency)', 'Sufficiency', 'Completeness', 'Consistency']
Row names: ['Data', 'Information', 'Knowledge']
Elements:

The convention for this pair-wise matrix operation uses " ⊙ "

[C] ⊙ [J] = [F]

Generate Matrix F first with the purely combinatorial first step of joining the corresponding (i,j) elements of [J] and [C].

Here this refers to the content of the cells as word strings used in semantic multiplication.

C(i,j) * J (i,j) = F(i,j)

So the Matrix level convention is [C] ⊙ [J] = [F] which means at the element level C(i,j) * J(i,j) = F(i,j) operating on word strings using semantic multiplication to resolve meanings.

Generate Matrix F first with the purely combinatorial first step of joining the corresponding (i,j) elements of [J] and [C].

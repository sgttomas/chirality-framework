## Combinitorial Construction for Matrix D
## Matrix D 
[D]
{{station}}
Dimensions: {{n_rows}} × {{n_cols}}  (i x j)
Row labels: {{rows_json}}
Column labels: {{cols_json}}
Elements:

Create Matrix D = A + F using semantic matrix addition.

The elements of Matrix D, denoted as D(i,j), are generated as follows,

for each row i and each column j:

D(i,j) = A(i,j) + " applied to frame the problem; “ + F(i,j) + " to resolve the problem.”

Generate this purely mechanical construction of word strings and concatenations complete with the semantic operator in place ( + )

### Output format
Return **only** valid JSON in this shape:

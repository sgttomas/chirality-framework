## Combinitorial Construction for Matrix {{matrix_id}}
## Matrix {{matrix_id}} 
[{{matrix_id}}]
{{station}}
Dimensions: {{n_rows}} × {{n_cols}} 
Row labels: {{rows_json}}
Column labels: {{cols_json}}
Elements:

This uses the " · " as a semantic matrix dot product operator.

[K] · [J] = [X]

[X] is made first by the purely combinatorial step of using the content of [K] and [J] to populate the elements of [X] following the convention for semantic dot product operations. 

Generate this purely mechanical construction of word pairs and concatenations complete with the semantic operators in place ( * , + )

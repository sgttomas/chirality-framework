Matrix K is the transpose of the final lens-interpreted Matrix D.   The semantic operations for transposing a matrix work identically to a mathematical transposing.  Each element is swapped column for row.

### Transform to Matrix K  
Apply the transpose operation to Matrix D to create Matrix K:
- K[i,j] = D[j,i]

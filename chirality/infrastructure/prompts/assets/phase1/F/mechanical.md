The convention for this pair-wise matrix operation uses " ⊙ "

[C] ⊙ [J] = [F]

Generate Matrix F first with the purely combinatorial first step of joining the corresponding (i,j) elements of [J] and [C].

Here this refers to the content of the cells as word strings used in semantic multiplication.

C(i,j) * J (i,j) = F(i,j)


So the Matrix level convention is [C] ⊙ [J] = [F] which means at the element level C(i,j) * J(i,j) = F(i,j) operating on word strings using semantic multiplication to resolve meanings.

Generate this purely mechanical construction of word pairs with the semantic operator in place ( * )

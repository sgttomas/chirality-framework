## Station Shift and Lens Application for Matrix {{matrix_id}}

Matrix {{matrix_id}}
Station: {{station}}
Dimensions: {{n_rows}} Ã— {{n_cols}} 
Row labels: {{rows_json}}
Column labels: {{cols_json}}
Elements:
[X] -> [Z]

The construction of Matrix Z is another form of operation which is a semantic shift -> while remaining in the same ontological modality as Matrix X (same row and column names).

The semantic shift is applied through the interpretive lens operation.

Now apply the interpretive lenses that were provided in the conversation history above to create the final lensed interpretation of Matrix {{matrix_id}}.

Using the lens matrix for the {{station}} station from above, for each element in matrix {{matrix_id}} at present, interpret the meaning of the word string through the corresponding lens. Your final output should be statements that capture the essence of what was lensed.

Generate the final interpreted Matrix {{matrix_id}}.

### Output format
Once the final lensing of Matrix Z has been produced through normal text, then output **only** valid JSON in this shape:

{{json_tail}}

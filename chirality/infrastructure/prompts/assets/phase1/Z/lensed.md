## Station Shift and Lens Application for Matrix {{matrix_id}}

Matrix {{matrix_id}}
Station: {{station}}

[X] -> [Z]

This stage applies a semantic shift from Verification to Validation using the interpretive lenses, while remaining in the same ontological modality (same rows and columns).

Important: This layer must explicitly reference the Matrix X **lensed** layer from conversation history. Use the statements produced in Matrix X **lensed** as the source content, and apply the Validation lenses elementâ€‘wise to produce Matrix {{matrix_id}} (Z) **lensed**.

Instructions:
- For each element, take the corresponding X **lensed** statement from history.
- Apply the corresponding Validation lens to produce a concise lensed statement.
- Do not introduce new operators; this is a pure lensing step.

### Output format
Once the final lensing of Matrix {{matrix_id}} has been produced then return final output in a table using markdown format.

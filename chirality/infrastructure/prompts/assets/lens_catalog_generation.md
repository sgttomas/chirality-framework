Generate interpretive lenses for the "{{STATION}}" station using the normative formula:
[station_meaning * row_name * column_name]

Recall logical progression of stations to generate reliable knowledge (semantic valley): if problem statement, then requirements, then objectives, then verification, then validation, then evaluation, then assessment, then implementation, then reflection and resolution.

We are at "{{STATION_CONTEXT}}"

Now to generate the interpretive lens for each element:
First take meaning of the corresponding column name as one ontology and the meaning of the corresponding row name as another ontology and find the intersection of meaning and then synthesize that meaning with the meaning of the "{{STATION}}" station along the semantic valley.

Then apply that meaning as the lens for interpreting the contents of the element in question.  Proceed one element at a time in this manner [ station_meaning_in_semantic_valley * row_name * column_name * ]

Generate these element-wise interpretive lenses

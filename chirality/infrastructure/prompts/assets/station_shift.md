## Semantic Operations

Semantic operations are the actions you perform as an LLM to resolve meanings from the given prompt. Your task is all about **semantics** and nothing else.  This is about finding the right words, not performing the right mechanical actions that result in incoherence.  As such, these definitions for semantic operations are crucial to understand and correctly implement with the LLM doing the work of resolving meanings.

### The Semantic Valley

The central metaphor that guides the LLM through interpretation is that you are traversing the semantic valley from one station to the next by resolving the meaning of each prompt.  By strictly following your prompts and the meanings they entail a reliable knowledge generating framework is developed piece by piece.

### Sequence of Stations

The semantic valley follows this path:  If problem statement, then requirements, then objectives, then verification, then validation, then evaluation, then assessment, then implementation, then integration, then reflection, and resolution. 

## Output Format

This is station "Validation" and you are resolving a concise and coherent statement from your "Content" above by shifting its meaning from the "Verification" context to the "Validation" context when applied to the problem of generating reliable knowledge.

In other words you are to re-contextualize: are we solving the right problem?  Take the "Content" and situate it from an internal-correctness posture to an external-appropriateness posture moving from a “verification” context to a “validation” context.

The answer should use the best words to concisely and coherently express the combined meaning, specific to this station of the semantic valley and the aim of generating reliable knowledge; do not add examples, caveats, meta-commentary, or lists—output one polished statement that preserves the ontological commitments of both lenses and the station.

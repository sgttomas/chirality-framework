## Interpreting the elements of Matrix C

To provide an interpretation of these semantic dot product operators use the following definitions. 

#### Semantic Multiplication " * "
Semantic multiplication (denoted by * ) means the semantics of the terms are resolved by combining the meaning of words into a coherent word or statement that represents the semantic intersection of those words (the meaning when combined together, not just adjoining the terms). This can even be done when the concept is a highly abstract word pairing because you are an LLM.

Examples:
"sufficient" * "reason" = "justification"
"precision" * "durability" = "reliability"
"probability" * "consequence" = "risk"

### Semantic Addition " + "

Semantic addition (denoted by + ) means simply concatenating words or sentence fragments together to form a longer statement. 
Example:
"faisal" + "has" + "seven" + "balloons" = faisal has seven balloons

### Order of Operations

To resolve a meaning follow this order of operations:

1. Apply semantic multiplication first, 
2. then semantic addition 

Generate this iteration of [C] 

Apply semantic multiplication first, and then semantic addition. Do not leave any operators (" * " or " + ") in the final word string

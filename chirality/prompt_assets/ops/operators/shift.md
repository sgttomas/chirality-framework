<!-- Operator: Validation Shift (Verification â†’ Validation) -->
<!-- Maintainer-authored content required. -->

<!-- Purpose: Define how to reframe an X (Verification) result into Z (Validation),
     changing the interpretive purpose while preserving content fidelity. -->

<!-- Allowed placeholders: none beyond what lensing will provide later; this operator is
     included before combined lensing to define the shift semantics in Stage 2 for Z. -->

<!-- Guidance topics to cover (for maintainer):
 - What distinguishes Validation from Verification in intent and evaluation posture.
 - How to recontextualize without adding new external content.
 - Output discipline: produce a reframed content unit ready for lensing.
-->

<!-- Template body (maintainer to supply wording) -->
<!-- TODO: Provide operator instructions for the Validation shift. -->

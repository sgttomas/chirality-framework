## The Semantic Valley

The framework follows a logical progression of stations to generate reliable knowledge. An in the central metaphor that guides the LLM through interpretation, you are traversing the semantic valley from one station to the next by resolving the meaning of once cell at a time in the given context.  

### Sequence of Stations

The semantic valley follows this path:  If problem statement, then requirements, then objectives, then verification, then validation, then evaluation, then assessment, then implementation, then integration, then reflection, and resolution. 

### Interpretation

This is station {{station_id}} and you are resolving a concise and coherent statement in a cell of the semantic component at that station in the context of generating reliable knowledge. 

Re-contextualize: are we solving the right problem?  Take the cell contents from the previous step of resolving meaning ({{content}}) and situate it from an internal-correctness posture to an external-appropriateness posture for Station Z moving from a "verification" context to a "validation" context so that each "verified":<facet> becomes its "validated":<facet> counterpart and any narrative framing moves from logical coherence and criterion match to situational fitness and problem–world alignment.

### Output

The answer should use the best words to concisely and coherently express the combined meaning, specific to this station of the semantic valley and the aim of generating reliable knowledge; do not add examples, caveats, meta-commentary, or lists—output one polished statement that preserves the ontological commitments of both lenses and the station.
